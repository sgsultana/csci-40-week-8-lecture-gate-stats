# csci-40-week-8-lecture-gate-stats
Starter code for lecture on arrays and structs

Welcome to the Week 8 assignment for CSCI-40! This repository contains the starter code for `game_stats.cpp`, which we'll use to build a program analyzing the Detroit Lions' 38-30 win over the Baltimore Ravens (9/22/2025) using arrays and structs. During the lecture, you'll code along, adding array operations, structs, and Git commits to your own repository.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps before class to prepare for week 8 lecture:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **GitHub Account**: Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you don’t have one.
- IF USING OWN LAPTOP **Git**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Run `git --version` in a terminal to confirm (should show version, e.g., 2.45.2).
- IF USING OWN LAPTOP **Visual Studio**: Install Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 (Community Edition is free) with C++ and Git support. Download from [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### 2. Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment
- Check the course Canvas Announcement for the GitHub Classroom invitation link (just accept the assignment link for week 8 lecture).
- Click the link, accept the assignment, and you will then have created your private repository (e.g., `game-stats-abc123`).
- Copy your repository’s URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/game-stats-abc123`).

### 3. Clone Class Repository
1. Open Visual Studio 2019/2022.
2. Go to **File > Clone Repository**.
3. Paste your repository URL.
4. Choose a local or cloud directory (e.g., `C:\Projects\lions-game-stats-yourname`).
5. Click **Clone**. This downloads `game_stats.cpp` and this README.
6. In Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, open `game_stats.cpp`. It should contain:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   int main() {
       cout << "Welcome to Lions Game Stats - Beat the Ravens!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
